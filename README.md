# A Gentle Introduction to Relativistic Dynamics And Electromagnetism

This is a long paper (or short book) on relativistic dynamics and electromagnetism that Iâ€™ve been working on for some time, written in LaTeX. The `.tex` file is an eyesore, and trying to prettify it with a hard line-wrap at this stage causes too many breaking bugs to count, but the [PDF it generates](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzbijOFcLYkTSWJ5R0s5U1ZMYWM) looks great. I hope to finish it soon.
