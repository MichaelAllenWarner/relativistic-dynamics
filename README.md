# A Gentle Introduction to Relativistic Dynamics And Electromagnetism

This is a long paper (or short book) on relativistic dynamics and electromagnetism that Iâ€™ve been working on for some time, written in LaTeX. Feel free to download the [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzbijOFcLYkTSWJ5R0s5U1ZMYWM/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-VMvPOHPxyPgNhBhy-7ZcDQ). Disclaimer: I am not a physicist.
