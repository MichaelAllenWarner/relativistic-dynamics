An alternative view on the importance of the mass-energy equivalence.

In Einstein’s 1905 paper on E=mc^2, he proposes a thought experiment in which a body moving at a constant velocity emits two equally energetic light pulses in opposite directions. With the aid of his newly developed special relativity, he shows how the energy of the body is affected.

Here, I want to walk through this problem, but first without the aid of special relativity. What can we say about that light-emitting body if we have Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell’s equations, but not Einstein’s spacetime?

Newton gives us p=mv and KE=m|v|^2/2, and we also have the conservation of mass, momentum, and total energy. From Maxwell, we know that light is a wave that carries energy and momentum in proportional magnitudes, even though it has no mass. In other words, light is exempt from Newton’s mass-dependent equations p=mv and KE=m|v|^2/2, but it still has E∝|p|>0. (Maxwell also tells us that light waves have frequency f∝E, which we’ll make use of a bit later.)

First, let’s consider the situation from the perspective of an observer moving with the body at the same speed. For this observer, the body is at rest and therefore has no initial velocity, momentum, or kinetic energy. The light pulses, however, carry away energy, and energy conservation tells us that the body must somehow lose that same amount of energy. Does it come from the body’s kinetic energy?

No. The short answer is that the KE was already 0, and KE can’t be negative. The longer answer goes like this: because light has |p|∝E, our equally energetic light pulses must carry momenta that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, and for momentum to be conserved, those equal-but-opposite momenta must cancel, leaving the body’s momentum unaffected. And since the body’s mass is likewise unaffected (because light is massless), the body’s v=p/m doesn’t change, and neither therefore does its KE, which depends on mass and speed.

So if the emission of light didn’t affect the resting body’s kinetic energy, how does the body lose energy? Newton can’t tell us, but we can be sure (assuming our priors are correct) that the body DOES lose energy. That energy can only have come from within the body itself. Put differently, a resting body capable of emitting light must already contain energy. Unlike kinetic energy, this new form of energy we’ve discovered is completely unrelated to the body’s motion. All observers will agree that it’s there, regardless of their velocity. When velocity equals zero, kinetic energy equals zero, and our new form of energy constitutes the ENTIRETY of the body’s energy. Think about it: what other energy can a body have aside from that related to its motion and that which is internal to it? None! So we can define our new energy as the energy a body has when it’s at rest. We’ll call it “rest energy,” or E_0, and we can now write total energy E=E_0+KE, where different observers will disagree on the velocity-dependent KE but will always agree on E_0. When the body’s at rest, E=E_0.

Note that we’ve inferred the existence of velocity-independent rest energy without recourse to special relativity. Just with Newton and Maxwell, we have E=E_0+KE.

How do things look to an observer who IS moving in relation to the body? From this perspective, the body has non-zero velocity, momentum, and kinetic energy.

The reasoning will be familiar. By E∝|p|, we know that the equally energetic light pulses carry momenta that are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For momentum to be conserved, those equal but opposite momenta must cancel, leaving the body’s momentum unaffected. The body’s mass is likewise unaffected, since light is massless. Therefore the body’s velocity remains the same (v=p/m), as does its kinetic energy (KE=m|v|^2/2).

Nonetheless, energy conservation tells us that the body must lose energy. Where did that energy come from, if not the body’s kinetic energy? Same answer as in the rest frame: the body lost rest energy.

So far so good! Our observer at rest and our moving observer seem to agree that the body loses rest energy to the light pulses, and since all observers should agree on E_0, our two observers must calculate the same initial and final values for the body’s rest energy, and thus also the same value for the body’s ∆E_0, which is equal to the total energy of the emitted light.

Lovely.

But we’ve forgetton something!

Remember: Maxwell tells us that light is a wave with frequency f∝E. What is frequency? It’s the number of wave oscillations that pass through a point per unit of time (say, per second). And the Doppler effect tells us that an observer moving in relation to a wave’s source won’t receive the same number of oscillations per second as an observer at rest will. (This is why you hear a siren’s pitch change as it drives by: your relative motion to the vehicle alters the rate at which sound-wave oscillations hit your ear drums.) For us, this means that our moving observer and our resting observer will NOT agree on the frequency of the emitted light pulses, and since light’s energy is proportional to its frequency, we must conclude that our observers will NOT agree on the total energy of the light pulses, ∆E_0!

We’ve reached an impasse. On the one hand, conservation of energy demands that both observers agree on the value of ∆E_0. On the other hand, well, that’s impossible.

What gives?

This is where Einstein comes in.

When Einstein wrote about this thought experiment, he’d already published his first paper on special relativity. In that earlier work, he demonstrated that if observers at motion relative to one another always agree on the speed of light (which they do), then they can never exactly agree on measurements of distance and time. At everyday speeds that we’re used to, the discrepancy in distance and time measurements for observers in relative motion is far too small to notice. As the relative speed approaches the speed of light, however, the discrepancy gets ever larger, and Newtonian physics no longer work.

Now, as a consequence of this, all other Newtonian measurements that depend on distance or time likewise fail at very high relative speeds. Newtonian momentum and kinetic energy, for instance, both depended on velocity, but velocity in turn depends on distance and time. So Einstein realized that he’d have to derive some new equations that merely APPROXIMATE the Newtonian ones at low speeds. Our old friends p=mv and KE=m|v|^2/2 will need to be replaced. More on that later.

Another measurement that needed tweaking was the frequency of light. Einstein showed that if all observers agree on light’s speed, then its measured frequency still depends on relative motion, but in a particular way. I never gave you the old Doppler equation, because we didn’t need it, but we will need the new one: if the observer’s relative velocity to the source is v, and if the light emitted from the source forms an angle θ with the imaginary straight line connecting source to observer, then the observer measures the light’s frequency fl’=fl[(1-(v/c)cosθ)/√(1-(v/c)^2)], where c is the speed of light and fl (for Frequency of Light) is the frequency measured by an observer at rest relative to the source. I won’t show you Einstein’s derivation of that equation, but do note that he derived it directly from special relativity and Maxwell’s equations.

And speaking of Maxwell’s equations, they don’t need any adjusting at all to conform with special relativity. So light still has |p|∝E∝f>0. And because that direct proportionality holds, we can take Einstein’s Doppler equation and replace the frequency terms with energy terms: El’=El[(1-(v/c)cosθ)/√(1-(v/c)^2)]. This new equation tells us how much energy a light pulse has according to an observer in motion relative to the source. El (for Energy of Light) is the energy of a light wave as measured by an observer at rest relative to the source.

This relativistic Doppler math is a bit cumbersome, but we’ll soon see that it works out quite nicely in our (Einstein’s) thought experiment.

Remember now, we’re hoping that special relativity will save us from our conundrum. We’re trying to maintain the principle of energy conservation by demanding that all observers agree on the body’s ∆E_0. Without special relativity, we were sure that all observers would agree that ∆E_0 was equal to the energy carried away by the light, but that was only because our equation for kinetic energy depended on mass and speed, and Newtonian physics told us that those were unaffected. Faced with the knowledge that we need a new KE equation, we will drop those prior assumptions. Perhaps it will turn out that not all observers agree that ∆E_0 is equal to the energy carried away by the light pulses. All we can say with certainty about KE right now is that it depends on relative motion (but not necessarily ONLY on relative motion), and that total energy E=E_0+KE, where all observers agree on the value of E_0.

That last part is crucial. The concept of velocity-independent rest energy remains intact. In fact, Einstein formulated this concept in precisely the same context that we did: in his thought experiment about the light-emitting body.

So here are our NEW priors:

Our light pulses are specified to have equal energy (El) in the body’s rest frame.
For each pulse, a moving observer gets energy El’=El[(1-(v/c)cosθ)/√(1-(v/c)^2)].
For our moving body, E=E_0+KE according to all observers.
All observers agree on the value of E_0, whereas KE is velocity-dependent.
We don’t yet have an equation for KE in terms of velocity. Maybe we can find one.

Before we proceed, let’s establish some notation. For measurements made by the observer moving relative to the body, we’ll add a prime symbol (‘). Also, measurements made before the emission of light pulses will be marked with an i (for “initial”), while measurements made after the emission will be marked with an f (for “final”). So the initial kinetic energy of the body according to the moving observer is KE’i, and the final total energy of the body according to the observer at rest relative to it is Ef. Note that since all observers agree on the body’s E_0, we have E_0i=E_0’i, and also E_0f=E_0’f, and therefore ∆E_0=∆E_0’ (we’ll only used the un-primed versions of these).

Now let’s retrace Einstein’s steps.

For the observer at rest relative to the body, KEi=KEf=0 and we have:

Ei=E_0i
Ef=E_0f=E_0i-∆E_0
∆E_0=2El

Simple.

What about the observer moving relative to the body?

Because the otherwise-identical light pulses are emitted in directions exactly opposite to each other (180˚ apart), any moving observer measuring their energy will conveniently find that the cosines of their corresponding angles in the Doppler equation are additive inverses of each other (i.e., cos(θ+180˚)=-cosθ). And since the light pulses are specified as having equal energies according to an observer at rest relative to the body, Er for one pulse equals Er for the other. For our moving observer, then, the sum of the energies of the light pulses is not difficult to compute. Simply add:

El[(1-(v/c)cosθ)/√(1-(v/c)^2)] + El[(1-(v/c)cos(θ+180˚)/√(1-(v/c)^2)]

= 2El/√(1-(v/c)^2)

= ∆E_0/√(1-(v/c)^2)

Now we have the total energy of the light pulses as measured by the moving observer. Note that it’s NOT equal to the rest energy lost by the body!

With that in hand, let’s calculate E’i and E’f:

E’i=E_0i+KE’i
E’f=E’i-∆E’=E_0i+KE’i-(∆E_0/√(1-(v/c)^2))

Note now that:

KE’i=E’i-E_0i=E’i-Ei, and also that
KE’f=E’f-E_0f=E’f-Ef.

Therefore, the difference between (E’i-Ei) and (E’f-Ef) is ∆KE’. So:

∆KE’=(E’i-Ei)-(E’f-Ef)

=[(E_0i+KE’i) - E_0i] - [(E_0i+KE’i)-(∆E_0/√(1-(v/c)^2)) - (E_0i-∆E_0)]

=(∆E_0/√(1-(v/c)^2)) - ∆E_0

=∆E_0(1/√(1-(v/c)^2) - 1)

And if we drop the deltas, we have our new equation for kinetic energy!

KE = E_0(1/√(1-(v/c)^2) - 1).

Note that KE now depends on velocity AND on rest energy. That solves our problem! From the perspective of our moving observer, the body’s velocity doesn’t change when it emits the light pulses, but its rest energy does, which means that its kinetic energy does, too! So all observers agree on the body’s ∆E_0, but moving observers see an additional corresponding decrease in kinetic energy. And where did that extra energy go? Into the light pulses! That’s what Einstein’s relativistic Doppler shift told us: the moving observer measured the light pulses as MORE ENERGETIC than the rest observer did (∆E_0/√(1-(v/c)^2) as opposed to ∆E_0).

Did you notice that KE doesn’t depend on anything called “mass”? Did you notice that we haven’t even mentioned “mass” since we forsook our Newtonian equations? If not, look again.

Maybe you miss it. Maybe you wonder where it fits in.

Well, my first response to that is: we don’t need it. Honestly. You can do all of modern physics without “mass.”

My second response is to show you how it can fit in if you want it to.

To verify that our new equation for kinetic energy is correct, we should see whether it approximates our old Newtonian equation when v<<c. So let’s do that.

KE = E_0(1/√(1-(v/c)^2) - 1)

Take a look at that first term in the parentheses, which can we be rewritten (1-(v/c)^2)^-1/2. It’s a bit unwieldy, but the binomial theorem can make it more manageable:

(a+x)^n = a^n + na^(n-1)x + (n(n-1)/2!)a^(n-2)x^2 + …

Let a=1, x=-(v/c)^2, and n=-1/2, and we have:

(1-(v/c)^2)^-1/2 = 1 + (1/2)(v/c)^2 + ((-1/2)(-3/2)/2!)(v/c)^4 + …

But we’re only interested in v<<c, and if v<<c, then (v/c)^4 << (v/c)^2, and so we can ignore the (v/c)^4 term and all other higher-order terms in the series. We’re left with  1 + (1/2)(v/c)^2. Let’s plug that back in as the first term in the parentheses in our kinetic energy equation:

KE ~ E_0((1 + (1/2)(v/c)^2) - 1)

= E_0 + E_0(1/2)(v/c)^2 - E_0
= (E_0/c^2)(v^2/2)

Look familiar? It should. Our old equation was KE=(m)v^2/2. It seems that our new one does indeed reduce to the old one when v<<c, and, furthermore, that Newton’s mass is nothing more than E_0/c^2!

m=E_0/c^2






No, it’s not rest energy that needs to budge. That was actually a good idea! It’s “mass.”

What is mass, anyway? Strictly in Newtonian physics, I mean; what is mass? Mathematically, it’s the constant of proportionality that appears in equations like p=mv and KE=m|v|^2/2. But conceptually, it’s rather mysterious. It’s just some “stuff” that “things” have (well, except for the things that don’t have any, like photons), and the more of it things have the harder they are to move. Before Einstein, there was no deeper understanding of mass. It was simply a fundamental property of things, and physicists had to accept it, even though that bothered them. 

(Oh, and mass was also the “gravitational charge.” That bothered physicists, too, and Einstein remedied this with general relativity, but that’s a story for another day.)

I want to suggest that Einstein’s so-called mass-energy equivalence has some overlooked significance: it solved the mystery of mass by showing that mass isn’t fundamental at all. I’ll even go a step further and argue that Einstein and later physicists muddied the waters by continuing to use mass in relativity. Mass is a relic of classical physics that confuses people trying to learn modern physics. It should be discarded and replaced in every instance by rest energy, which really is fundamental.

Now, let’s briefly retrace Einstein’s steps. Remember, he’s asking the same question we did: what happens to an inertial body that emits a pair of equal-but-opposite photons along its axis of motion?

First step: acknowledge that the body loses energy that isn’t kinetic energy.

Second step: call it rest energy, but don’t think too hard about it; it’s just the energy the body has that’s unrelated to its motion.

So far so good. We already did all that!

Oh boy, you’re thinking too hard about it, aren’t you?

So what is that rest energy? Whatever it is, it’s “internal.” All sorts of things could be going on inside. It’s probably not absolute zero in there, so there’s bound to be at least some “internal” thermal energy. And maybe there are scientists in there conducting experiments, and who knows what kinds of energy are involved with that? Doesn’t matter. The point is, there must be energy in there, and from our perspective on the outside, the details don’t really matter, because all of the different “internal” energy contributions sum up to one total: rest energy. How do we know it’s there? Because the body lost energy to photons but its kinetic energy was unaffected.

Third step: realize that the body has no energy aside from its rest energy and its kinetic energy. That’s all there is. E = E_0 + KE, and if you’re at rest relative to the body, then KE = 0 and E = E_0.

Fourth step: you already know how to calculate rest energy. You just add up all the “internal” energy contributions! The real problem is kinetic energy, because, as defined in Newtonian physics, it depends on “mass,” which we’ve already determined is dumb.


As soon therefore as we, our attention being drawn to the fact by experience, have perceived in bodies the existence of a special property determinative of accelerations, our task with regard to it ends with the recognition and unequivocal designation of this fact. Beyond the recognition of this fact we shall not get, and every venture beyond it will only be productive of obscurity. All uneasiness will vanish when once we have made clear to ourselves that in the concept of mass no theory of any kind whatever is contained, but simply a fact of experience. The concept has hitherto held good. It is very improbable, but not impossible, that it will be shaken in the future, just as the conception of a constant quantity of heat, which also rested on experience, was modified by new experiences.
